/**
 * The Option type encapsulates an optional value.
 *
 * A value of type Option[A] either contains a value of type A (represented as Some A),
 *   or it is empty represented as None. Using Option is a good way to deal with errors
 *   without resorting to exceptions. The algebraic data type declaration is:
 *
 * datatype Option[A] = None
 *                    | Some A
 *
 * This Option type is inspired by the Haskell Maybe data type. The idiomatic way to
 *   employ an Option instance is as a monad using the functions map, inject, bind
 *   and filter. Given:
 *
 *   fun divide(num: Int, den: Int): Option<Int> ...
 *
 * then:
 *
 *   divide(a, c).bind{ac -> divide(b, c).bind{bc -> Some(Pair(ac, bc))}}
 *
 * finds the pair of divisions of a and b by c should c be an exact divisor.
